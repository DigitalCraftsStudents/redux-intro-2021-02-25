# Redux intro:

- The hello world of redux is a counter app.

# Activity 1: "real" banking

- do not allow balances to drop below 0
- alternatively: hit them with a 25 penalty for each withdrawal that causes a negative blanace

- if balance is higher than 500, reward them with +1% of the deposit amount

# Storing Arrays in State:

Next example: add a Transactions slice + reducer to app.

- add an entry for every deposit/withdrawal
- include date


Allows us to show all transactions as a list in React (that updates in real-time).
